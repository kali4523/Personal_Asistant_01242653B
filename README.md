# Personal Assistant Program

This is a simple Python terminal-based personal assistant created as part of a learning project by Prince Ayaata, a student of Technical University.

It asks the user a series of personal questions, generates a fun summary from the answers, and optionally saves the summary (and user rating) to a text file.
